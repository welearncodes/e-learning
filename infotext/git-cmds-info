"git init" is the first command for getting started with your very own repository. When you type in this command in your command line interface you will create a repository in the directory you are currently in when pressing enter.

Ex:
git init 

This will create a hidden file(.git) with all the basic information about your git repository will be stored.

You are now ready to start adding files to your repository.

git status

Once you have added files to your git repository you can check the status by typing git status.

The files you have created will then show up in red, this means they are not yet added to your repository.
Files that show up as green means they are added but not yet commit'ed

Ex:
git status

modified:   test.txt (red)
