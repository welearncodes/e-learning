<h1>Git Add</h1>
<hr>


<p>Once you are finished editing your files you are ready to add them you your git repository.</p>
<p>This is done using the "git add" command.</p>

<pre>
Ex:
git add test.txt 	/* adds the specified file */
git add .  			/* adds all the modified files in your directory */
git add *.txt 		/* add all .txt files in your directory */
</pre>

<p>Once you have added the files you can do "git status" and they will show up as green.</p>
