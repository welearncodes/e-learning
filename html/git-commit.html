<h1>Git commit</h1>
<hr>

<p>Saving changes - <pre>git commit</pre> stores the current contents/snapshot of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes. Commited changes are "safe" snapshots of the project - Git will never change them unless ask it to.</p>

<p>Ex:</p>
<pre>git commit -m "message"</pre>

<p>Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use message to commit the message.</p>
